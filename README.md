Code to take PDF files and convert to speech-reader. 

Short simple program to take a file in PDF format, and 
read the text out loud in audiobook fashion using python.
tkinter filedialogue opens your finder window for you,
allowing you to just click on which file you want to listen to. 
It's a convenient option, being that you don't have to hardcode
the filepath everytime you want to read a different file.
